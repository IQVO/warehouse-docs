    "description": "Event catalog for the **warehouse-planning** bounded context (WES\nsubdomain): *can this warehouse process the demand assigned to it?*\n\n**Published (Phase 4).** The `CapacityPlan` aggregate raises four events,\npublished to `warehouse.warehouse-planning.events` through a\n**transactional outbox**: the plan and its already-encoded events are\nwritten in ONE database transaction, and a relay drains them to Kafka\n(at-least-once; the CloudEvents `id` is persisted with the outbox row, so\na retry republishes the same `id` -- consumers dedupe on it). Per plan:\n`CapacityPlanCreated` on creation; on publication\n`CapacityPlanPublished`, plus `CapacityShortageDetected` and\n`BottleneckDetected` only when the plan has a shortage.\n`ProcessCapacityRegistered`/`ProcessCapacityChanged` are NOT published yet.\n\n**Consumed (Phase 3).** `ShiftPlanCommitted` (workforce-management) and\n`LocationSlotRegistered`/`LocationSlotDecommissioned` (facility-layout) keep\nlocal ProcessCapacity read models current; this context never makes a\nlive cross-context call.\n\n**Consumed (ADR 0004, opt-in).** `OrderAllocated` and\n`OrderPartiallyAllocated` (order-management, topic\n`warehouse.order-management.events`) keep a local expected-demand read\nmodel current when `DEMAND_CONSUMER_GROUP` is set (unset = no consumer).\nEach order is counted once, at its latest promise cutoff, and attributed to\nthe ONE configured site (`DEMAND_SITE_ID`): order-management's events carry\nno fulfillment site. `OrderRepromised` and every other type are ignored.\n\n**Analytics stream (ADR 0005).** The same four events are ALSO written to\n`warehouse.warehouse-planning.analytics` in the SAME outbox transaction\n(two outbox rows per event, one per topic), as CloudEvents 1.0 with the\nSAME `type` and the SAME `id` per occurrence but\n`dataschema=urn:warehouse:warehouse-planning:analytics:<EventName>:v1`.\nThe integration messages are byte-identical to what they were before the\nstream existed. The analytics payloads are the integration payloads plus\nadditive, analytics-only fields: today `binding_constraint` on\n`CapacityPlanPublished` (the constraint type -- LABOR, STATION, ... --\nbinding the bottleneck step; `\"\"` for a plan created before it was\nrecorded). Only this service's own `planning-projector` consumes it (fixed\nconsumer group, at-least-once, offsets committed after the projection\ncommitted), into a SEPARATE analytical database that\n`planning-reports` serves read-only. Poison messages go to\n`warehouse.warehouse-planning.analytics.dlq`.\n\n**Envelope (mandatory).** Every message is a CloudEvents 1.0 event in\n*structured content mode* (Kafka value = JSON event format) with the Kafka\nheader `content-type: application/cloudevents+json; charset=UTF-8`. All of\n`specversion` (`1.0`), `id`, `source` (`/warehouse/warehouse-planning`),\n`type`, `subject`, `time`, `datacontenttype` (`application/json`) and\n`dataschema` are required; the payload sits under `data`. No flat\nenvelope, no toggle.\n\n**Type naming.** `com.warehouse.wes.warehouse-planning.<entity>.<EventName>`\nwhere `<entity>` is the aggregate that raised the event, lowercase, no\nseparators -- here `capacityplan`. **dataschema** =\n`urn:warehouse:warehouse-planning:events:<EventName>:v1`. **subject** and\nthe Kafka message key = the capacity plan id (one plan's events stay\nordered on one partition). A breaking payload change gets a new `.v2`\ntype and dataschema, never a mutation.\n"
