# Ubiquitous language

:::info[Synced from inbound-receiving]
This page is a copy of [`docs/docs/ddd/ubiquitous-language.md`](https://github.com/IQVO/inbound-receiving/blob/develop/docs/docs/ddd/ubiquitous-language.md) on `develop`, derived from that repository's code. Edit it there, then re-sync.
:::


Every term the inbound dock uses, mapped to the identifier that implements it.
Code identifiers are from `internal/domain/*`, wire names from
`apis/openapi.yaml` (camelCase) and `apis/asyncapi.yaml` (snake_case).

## Documents

## Words that mean something else elsewhere

| Word | Here | Elsewhere in the fleet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Receive** | Count units at the dock against an ASN line. | In `inventory-storage`, `ReceiveStock` stages units in stock; this context hands it the Good lines. |
| **Door** | A facility-layout slot with role Dock. | In `facility-layout` it is a `LocationSlot`. |
| **Location** | Not used: this context never says where goods go. | `inventory-storage` / `facility-layout` own placement. |
