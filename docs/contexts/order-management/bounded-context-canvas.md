# Bounded Context Canvas

:::info[Synced from order-management]
This page is a copy of [`docs/docs/ddd/bounded-context-canvas.md`](https://github.com/IQVO/order-management/blob/develop/docs/docs/ddd/bounded-context-canvas.md) on `develop`, derived from that repository's code. Edit it there, then re-sync.
:::


Follows the
[ddd-crew Bounded Context Canvas v5](https://github.com/ddd-crew/bounded-context-canvas).
Every message row maps to a real REST route
(`internal/adapters/inbound/http/server.go`), MCP tool
(`internal/adapters/inbound/mcp`) or Kafka topic and CloudEvents type
(the publishers in `internal/adapters/outbound/kafka`, the consumers listed
under Inbound Communication).

## Name

**Order Management** (`order-management`). CloudEvents source
`/warehouse/order-management`, type prefix
`com.warehouse.wes.order-management.order.`.

## Purpose

Accept customer and network demand as orders, reserve stock for every line
in inventory-storage, promise each shipment group a carrier cutoff the
building can actually meet, and release allocated lines to
wes-work-planning — while keeping the order cancellable until release and
holding network-originated orders until their caller commits.

## Strategic Classification

| Dimension | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Domain | **Generic/Supporting** — see [Core Domain Chart](/contexts/order-management/core-domain-chart) and [Subdomain Classification](https://github.com/IQVO/order-management/blob/develop/docs/docs/ddd/subdomain-classification.md) |
| Business Model | **Compliance / engagement enabler** — no revenue of its own; makes the fulfillment promise to the customer that the Core contexts then keep |
| Evolution | Intake: commodity. Allocation and hold/release: product. Capability-derived promise, multi-path routing, re-promise: custom |

## Domain Roles

- **Gateway** — the platform's front door for demand (`POST /orders`),
  for both direct callers and network-fulfillment.
- **Execution** — runs allocation, release and cancellation against
  inventory-storage and announces released work.
- **Analysis (light)** — computes the delivery promise from upstream
  capability, schedule and capacity read models, and publishes an
  analytics event stream for its own funnel projector.

## Ubiquitous Language

Full glossary: [Ubiquitous Language](/contexts/order-management/ubiquitous-language).
Top terms:

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Order / Order line | The aggregate and its entity (`order.Order`, `order.OrderLine`) |
| Allocation | Reserving stock for a line in inventory-storage |
| Backordered | A line inventory-storage answered `409` for |
| Release | Marking allocated lines `Released` and announcing them on Kafka |
| Ship-complete | Release nothing until every line is allocated (BR3) |
| Held order | Allocated but waiting for `POST /orders/{id}/release` (ADR 0020) |
| Promise / promise group | The CPT window a shipment group is promised to leave by |
| Promise basis | `Capability`, `LeadTime` or `Network` |
| Process path | The building workflow a line is routed to (`PathSelectionPolicy`) |

## Business Decisions

- **BR2 — fail closed on ambiguity.** Only inventory-storage's `409`
  backorders a line; any other failure aborts the allocation pass (ADR 0003).
- **BR3 — ship-complete by default.** `allowPartialShipment` defaults to
  `false`; a ship-complete order releases nothing while a line is
  unallocated (ADR 0003).
- **BR6 — cancellation boundary at release.** No cancel once any line is
  `Released`; released work is not clawed back (ADR 0004).
- **Release is a published fact, not a call** (ADR 0005).
- **Promise from capability** — CPT schedule, path cycle time and capacity,
  per shipment group; lead time only as fallback (ADR 0014, 0017).
- **Path is chosen, never supplied** — shortest known cycle time among
  eligible active paths, `pick` as fallback (ADR 0013, 0016, 0021).
- **Held orders must be ship-complete** (ADR 0020).
- **Reservations are reconfirmed before release**; a lapsed one becomes a
  backorder.
- **Planned capacity annotates, never moves, a promise** (ADR 0031).

## Assumptions

- inventory-storage is the single source of truth for stock; this context
  never caches stock levels.
- One site per deployment: the promise uses `DEFAULT_SITE_ID`, and the
  planned-capacity annotation uses `PLANNED_CAPACITY_SITE_ID` (defaulting to
  the same value).
- wes-work-planning accepts every released line; there is no confirmation
  event back.
- Upstream catalogue, CPT-schedule and capacity topics are replayable from
  the first offset (local caches rebuild on every start).
- REST and MCP are unauthenticated (ADR 0012); network-level controls are
  outside this repo.

## Verification Metrics

| Metric | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Orders accepted vs rejected at intake | `ports.OrderMetrics` (`internal/adapters/outbound/telemetry`) |
| Funnel: received, allocated, partially allocated, failed, cancelled, backordered lines | `funnel_rollup` via `cmd/order-projector`, [Order Funnel report](https://iqvo.github.io/order-management/docs/analytics/order-funnel-report) |
| Promise basis mix, split shipments, promise-to-cutoff gap | `funnel_rollup` (ADR 0019), MCP `get_promise_health` |
| Re-promises per hour | `repromise_rollup` |
| Outbox lag | `order.outbox.lag_seconds` gauge (ADR 0032) |

## Open Questions

- `OrderLineReleased`/`OrderReleased` are declared and projected but never
  raised — keep them, raise them, or delete them? Until decided, the
  funnel's released columns stay at zero.
- `ship-complete-blocked` (409) is mapped but unreachable over HTTP; should
  a BR3-blocked release report that to the caller?
- No consumer of `OrderRepromised` on the integration topic is known — does
  wes-work-planning or network-fulfillment need it?
- **Held orders are never swept.** Nothing expires an orphaned hold; ADR
  0020 names network-fulfillment as the natural owner of a sweeper.
- No release confirmation from wes-work-planning (fire-and-forget,
  README Deferred list).
