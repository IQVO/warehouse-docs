# Bounded context canvas

This page is a copy of [`docs/docs/ddd/bounded-context-canvas.md`](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/ddd/bounded-context-canvas.md) on `develop`, derived from that repository's code. Edit it there, then re-sync.

[ddd-crew Bounded Context Canvas v5](https://github.com/ddd-crew/bounded-context-canvas).
Every message row maps to a real route in
`internal/adapters/inbound/http/router.go`, a real MCP tool in
`internal/adapters/inbound/mcp/`, or a real Kafka topic and CloudEvents type
in the consumers and publishers.

## Name

**Fulfillment Execution** (`fulfillment-execution`, CloudEvents subdomain
`wes`, `source` `/warehouse/fulfillment-execution`).

## Purpose

Turn released work into physically completed work on the warehouse floor.
Each released work unit becomes a `Task` (Pick, Rebin, Pack or SLAM) that a
station **pulls** when it is free; the context guarantees that a task is
held by at most one station at a time (a time-boxed lease), that it is done
by a station with the right capabilities, and that the earliest CPT is
served first. It also seals packages (with DOT hazard segregation), runs the
SLAM weigh-check, consolidates an order's lines at Rebin, and reports
completions and missed CPTs back to planning, labour and order management.

## Strategic Classification

| Dimension | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Domain** | **Core** | Pull-based dispatch with lease semantics is the throughput differentiator; see [Subdomain classification](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/ddd/subdomain-classification.md) and [Core domain chart](/contexts/fulfillment-execution/core-domain-chart). Pack and SLAM slices are Supporting and kept thin. |
| **Business model** | **Cost reduction / operational efficiency** | It earns nothing directly; it raises units per hour and on-time-to-CPT shipment, measured by the throughput and on-time-to-CPT reports ([ADR-0026](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0026-on-time-to-cpt-kpi.md)). |
| **Evolution** | **Custom-built** | Built in-house, still gaining behaviour (claim compare-and-set, Rebin, package read model are recent ADRs). |

## Domain Roles

- **Execution context** — owns the task lifecycle (Pending → Claimed →
  Completed) and the claim/lease rules.
- **Enforcer** — enforces at-most-once claiming, capability matching, DOT
  segregation and the SLAM weigh tolerance.
- **Gateway to the floor (strategic)** — the only context that would talk to
  equipment (WCS), behind a deliberately empty anti-corruption seam
  ([ADR-0015](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0015-wcs-equipment-anti-corruption-seam.md)).
- **Analysis context (side role)** — owns its own throughput and
  on-time-to-CPT read model (`cmd/fulfillment-projector`,
  `cmd/fulfillment-reports`).

## Ubiquitous Language

The full glossary is on [Ubiquitous language](/contexts/fulfillment-execution/ubiquitous-language).
Top terms:

- **Task** — a unit of physical work with a type, a CPT and required
  capabilities.
- **claimNext** — pull dispatch: the station asks, the context answers with
  the earliest-CPT task it can do.
- **Lease** — a time-boxed claim (5 minutes by default) that returns the task
  to the pool on expiry.
- **CPT** — Critical Pull Time, the deadline that sets priority.
- **Station / Capability** — a work position and what it is certified and
  equipped for.
- **Package / Seal / SLAM** — the Pack output, closing it, and the
  weigh-check that labels or diverts it.
- **Rebin / OrderConsolidation** — fan-in of an order's lines before Pack.

## Business Decisions

- Dispatch is **pull, never push** — there is no `assign(task, station)`
  ([ADR-0002](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0002-pull-based-claimnext-dispatch.md),
  [Why pull, not push](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/business-context/why-pull-not-push.md)).
- Priority is **earliest CPT first**, nothing else.
- A task is claimed **at most once at a time**; a lapsed lease silently
  returns it to the pool
  ([ADR-0003](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0003-lease-based-at-most-once-claiming.md)).
- Capabilities are read from the **registered station**, not from the
  request.
- A weigh-check outside **±0.05** of the expected weight **diverts** the
  package — a domain outcome, not an error.
- Items with incompatible **DOT hazard classes** may not share a package
  ([ADR-0010](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0010-package-segregation-and-sort-lane.md)).
- A missed CPT is **reported, not enforced**, and re-reported on every sweep
  ([ADR-0025](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0025-cpt-missed-sweep-and-package-manifested.md)).
- The PACK task for a multi-line order is created **once, when the last
  line reaches Rebin** ([ADR-0016](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0016-rebin-and-order-consolidation.md)).

## Assumptions

- `wes-work-planning` releases work at the right rate; this context does not
  throttle intake.
- An external scheduler calls `POST /tasks/expire-leases` and
  `POST /tasks/sweep-cpt-misses`; no code in this repository schedules them.
  The Helm chart ships opt-in `CronJob`s for both (`sweeps.enabled`, default
  off).
- `WorkReleased.data.work_unit_id` is a stable correlation key, reused as
  `orderRef` and returned as `work_unit_id` on `TaskCompleted`.
- Hazard classification and location roles fail open: if the lookup is
  disabled or unavailable, sealing and registration proceed.
- Downstream consumers deduplicate on the CloudEvents `id` (outbox retries
  reuse it) and on their own business key for `TaskCPTMissed`.

## Verification Metrics

| Metric | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Completions, lease expiries, weigh-check diverts, claim-to-complete seconds per task type, station and hour | `throughput_rollup` (analytics DB), `GET /reports/throughput` |
| On-time-to-CPT: packages manifested on time vs late | `throughput_rollup.packages_on_time_cpt` / `packages_late_cpt`, MCP `get_on_time_to_cpt` |
| Queue depth per task type | `GET /queues/{taskType}/depth`, MCP `get_queue_status` |
| Report freshness | `GET /reports/throughput/freshness` |
| OpenTelemetry metrics (task completions, HTTP, Kafka) | `internal/observability/metrics.go` ([ADR-0019](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0019-standard-metrics-convention.md)) |

## Open Questions

- Should a station have to be **checked in** before it can claim? Today
  `ClaimNext` ignores occupancy.
- Should `ItemPicked` be raised (item-level Pick), or removed from the
  catalogue?
- Should `ItemArrivedAtRebin` and `OrderConsolidated` be published, and to
  whom?
- Who owns the **schedule** for the lease and CPT sweeps in production? (The
  chart can run them as opt-in `CronJob`s, `sweeps.enabled`; whether and how
  often to turn that on is a per-environment choice, and `TaskCPTMissed`
  volume scales with the CPT sweep's frequency.)
- When does the WCS seam get its first method, and which vendor protocol
  does it translate?
- MCP governance: authentication was removed fleet-wide
  ([ADR-0022](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0022-remove-rest-mcp-auth.md)); the governance charter
  §7–§8 remain unmet.
