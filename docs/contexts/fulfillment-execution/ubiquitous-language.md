# Ubiquitous language

:::info[Synced from fulfillment-execution]
This page is a copy of [`docs/docs/business-context/ubiquitous-language.md`](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/business-context/ubiquitous-language.md) on `develop`, derived from that repository's code. Edit it there, then re-sync.
:::


These are the exact names this bounded context uses. They appear in the
domain code, the REST API, the event catalogue and this documentation. Every
term below maps to a real identifier; where the code (or the wire) uses a
different name than the language, the **Code name differs?** column says so
and why. If a term here does not match an identifier in `internal/domain/` or
`internal/application/`, one of the two is wrong.

This page is the glossary artifact of the
[ddd-crew pack](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/ddd/ddd-artifacts.md).

## Core terms

| Term | Definition | Code identifier | Code name differs? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Task** | A unit of physical work. Has a type, a CPT, an order reference, a set of required capabilities, and two packing hints (Fragile, Gift wrap). At most one active claim, ever. | `task.Task` (`internal/domain/task/task.go`) | No |
| **Task type / Process path** | Pick / Pack / Rebin / SLAM as **named task types (queues)**, not as steps in a workflow. See [Process paths](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/business-context/process-paths.md). | `task.Type` = `task.Pick` `"PICK"`, `task.Pack` `"PACK"`, `task.Slam` `"SLAM"`, `task.Rebin` `"REBIN"` | **Yes** — called `taskType` in REST, `task_type` on events, `processPath` in MCP tool arguments (which accept only `PICK`, `PACK`, `SLAM` — not `REBIN`), and `PathDefinition.Id` in the catalogue |
| **Pending / Claimed / Completed** | The three task states. `Pending` is in the pool; `Claimed` is leased to exactly one station; `Completed` is terminal. | `task.Pending`, `task.Claimed`, `task.Completed` (`"PENDING"`, `"CLAIMED"`, `"COMPLETED"`) | No |
| **claimNext(stationId, capabilities)** | **PULL dispatch.** Returns the highest-priority (earliest CPT) pending task the station is certified and equipped for. The system never names a station in advance — there is deliberately no `assign(task, station)`. | `usecases.ClaimNext.Execute(ctx, stationId, taskType)`; `POST /stations/{stationId}/claim-next` | **Yes** — the code takes a `taskType`, not capabilities; capabilities are read from the persisted `Station` so a client cannot assert ones it lacks |
| **Claim** | The act of a station taking a task, enforcing at-most-once and capability match. | `task.Task.Claim`, persisted by `TaskRepo.SaveClaim` (compare-and-set) | No |
| **At-most-once** | The claim guarantee: two stations can never hold an active claim on the same task at the same time. | `task.ErrAlreadyClaimed`; `TaskRepo.SaveClaim` CAS ([ADR-0034](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0034-concurrency-control-for-consolidation-and-claim.md)) | No |
| **Lease** | A time-boxed claim. If not renewed or completed before expiry, the task returns to the pool. Renewal is allowed and expected for long work. | `task.Lease{StationId, Expiry}`; `usecases.DefaultLeaseDuration` = 5 min | No |
| **Lease renewal** | Extending an active lease; only the owner may renew. | `task.Task.RenewLease`, `usecases.RenewLease`; `POST /tasks/{id}/renew-lease` | No |
| **Lease expiry** | The `Claimed → Pending` edge. Evaluated lazily inside every claim/renew/complete, and eagerly by the sweep. | `task.Task.ExpireLeaseIfDue`, `usecases.ExpireLeases`, event `LeaseExpired`; `POST /tasks/expire-leases` | No |
| **Completion** | Finishing a claimed task; only the owner, only while the lease is active, never twice. | `task.Task.Complete`, `usecases.CompleteTask`, event `TaskCompleted` | No |
| **Station** | A work position with a capability set. One occupant at a time. | `station.Station` (`internal/domain/station/station.go`) | No |
| **Occupant / check-in / check-out** | Whoever (associate or robot) is at a station right now. Operational state only — no event. Read at publish time to stamp `associate_id` on `TaskCompleted`. | `station.OccupantId`, `Station.CheckIn` / `CheckOut`, `usecases.CheckInStation` / `CheckOutStation` | **Yes** — `occupantId` in REST, `associate_id` on the `TaskCompleted` wire payload |
| **Station location code** | Optional facility-layout `LocationCode` where a station physically sits; checked against facility-layout's WorkCenter role when `LOCATION_ROLE_MODE=http`. | `Station.LocationCode()` / `SetLocationCode`, `ports.LocationRoleLookup` ([ADR-0024](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0024-station-location-code-and-workcenter-role-check.md)) | No |
| **Capability** | An open string naming a certification or piece of equipment a station must have to accept a task. Known values: `pick`, `pack`, `rebin`, `slam`, `hazmat`. Compared as set containment. | `shared.Capability`, `shared.CapabilitySet.HasAll` | No |
| **Hazmat (capability)** | A capability like any other: a task requiring it can only be claimed by a station registered with it. No dedicated code path. | the string `"hazmat"` in `requiredCapabilities` ([ADR-0009](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0009-fragile-and-hazmat-handling-flags.md)) | No |
| **Fragile** | A `Task`-level packing hint, stamped by `wes-work-planning` at release time from `inventory-storage`'s product classification. Does not gate claiming. | `task.Task.Fragile()`; wire `data.fragile` | No |
| **Gift wrap** | A `Task`-level packing hint from a caller-stated `WorkReleased.data.gift_wrap` request (not a product classification). Does not gate claiming; no HTTP ingestion path. | `task.Task.GiftWrap()` ([ADR-0011](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0011-gift-wrap-handling-flag.md)) | **Yes** — `gift_wrap` on the inbound event, `giftWrap` on the REST task response |
| **Package** | Pack output: an order's contents becoming a sealed carton. | `pack.Package` in `internal/domain/package` | **Yes** — Go package name is `pack` because `package` is a keyword |
| **Scan** | Recording an item into an open package, checking DOT segregation against every already-scanned item. | `Package.ScanItem`, `Package.ScanItemWithClass` | No |
| **Seal** | Closing a package; impossible without scanned contents. | `Package.Seal`, `usecases.SealPackage`, event `PackageSealed`; `POST /tasks/{id}/seal-package` | No |
| **FragileHandling / GiftWrapRequested** | Package flags derived at construction from the owning PACK task's Fragile / GiftWrap. | `Package.FragileHandling()`, `Package.GiftWrapRequested()` | No |
| **DOT hazard class** | An integer 1-9 looked up live per scanned SKU at seal time; 0 means "no hazard class" (fail-open). | `ports.ClassificationInfo.DOTHazardClass`, `Package.ScannedHazardClasses()` | No |
| **Segregation** | The same-package rule that two scanned items' DOT hazard classes must be compatible per a class-level 49 CFR §177.848-derived matrix. | `pack.IsSegregationIncompatible`, `pack.ErrPackageSegregationViolation` ([ADR-0010](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0010-package-segregation-and-sort-lane.md)) | No |
| **SortLane** | The derived sortation routing decision: `HAZMAT_LANE` beats `FRAGILE_NO_TILT` beats `STANDARD`. A decision only — no WCS integration. | `Package.SortLane()`, `pack.SortLaneHazmat` / `SortLaneFragileNoTilt` / `SortLaneStandard` | No |
| **SLAM weigh-check** | Scan, Label, Apply, Manifest. The actual weight must be within tolerance of the expected weight, otherwise the package is diverted instead of labelled. | `Package.Weigh(expected, actual)`, `pack.WeightTolerance = 0.05`, `usecases.RunSlam`; `POST /packages/{id}/slam` | **Yes** — "weigh-check" is `Weigh`; the analytics payload names the weights `expected_g` / `actual_g` (grams) while the domain is unit-agnostic and the API examples use kilograms |
| **Labeled / Diverted** | The two SLAM outcomes. Diverted is a domain outcome, not an error. | `pack.Labeled` `"LABELED"`, `pack.Diverted` `"DIVERTED"`; events `LabelApplied`, `WeightDiscrepancyDetected`, `PackageDiverted` | **Yes** — the state is `Labeled`, the event is `LabelApplied` |
| **Manifested** | A package that passed SLAM and is promised to a carrier; feeds order-management's promise loop. | event `PackageManifested` ([ADR-0025](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0025-cpt-missed-sweep-and-package-manifested.md)) | **Yes** — no `Manifested` state exists; a manifested package is in state `LABELED` |
| **CPT** | **Critical Pull Time** — the deadline by which a task must be completed for its order to ship on schedule. Priority derives entirely from CPT. | `shared.CPT` (`internal/domain/shared/cpt.go`) | **Yes** — `apis/openapi.yaml` expands it as "Committed Processing Time" in three descriptions; same value, prose-only discrepancy |
| **CPT missed** | A task still open (Pending or Claimed) at or past its CPT. Reported, not enforced; re-reported on every sweep pass. | `task.Task.IsCPTMissed(now)`, `usecases.SweepCPTMisses`, event `TaskCPTMissed`; `POST /tasks/sweep-cpt-misses` | No |
| **OrderRef** | The reference back to the released work this task or package fulfils. | `shared.OrderRef` | **Yes** — populated from `WorkReleased.data.work_unit_id`, so it is wes-work-planning's **WorkUnit id** (`<orderId>-line-<lineNo>`), not an order-management order id; it is `work_unit_id` on `TaskCompleted`, `order_ref` on `TaskCPTMissed` / `PackageManifested`, `orderRef` in REST |
| **Queue depth** | How many `Pending` tasks of a given type sit in the pool. A projection computed on demand. | `usecases.GetQueueDepth`, `TaskRepo.CountByTypeAndStatus`; `GET /queues/{taskType}/depth`; MCP `get_queue_status` | No |
| **Installed capacity** | How many registered stations hold a capability, regardless of occupancy. A projection over the Station registry. | `usecases.GetInstalledCapacity`, `StationRepo.CountByCapability`; `GET /capacity/{capability}` ([ADR-0018](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0018-installed-capacity-read-endpoint.md)) | **Yes** — response field is `installed` |
| **Rebin / OrderConsolidation** | The fan-in of an order's required lines at Rebin; once every line has arrived the order's PACK task is created exactly once. | `consolidation.OrderConsolidation`, `usecases.ArriveAtRebin`; `POST /rebin/arrivals` ([ADR-0016](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0016-rebin-and-order-consolidation.md)) | **Yes** — the arrival command is `ArriveAtRebin` / `RecordArrival`, the event `ItemArrivedAtRebin` |
| **Required line / arrived line** | The line ids an order needs at Rebin, fixed by its first arrival; and the ones that have arrived. | `OrderConsolidation.RequiredLineIds()` / `ArrivedLineIds()`; REST `requiredLineIds`, `lineId` | No |
| **Process-path catalogue** | The declared set of process paths (id, match prefix, required capabilities) a `path_id` resolves against — configuration, not code. | `pathcatalog.Catalogue`, `pathcatalog.PathDefinition`, `ports.PathCatalogue` ([ADR-0017](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0017-process-path-catalogue-as-configuration.md)) | No |
| **Package read model** | A side-effect-free read of a package's current state — how a caller learns the SLAM outcome after the outcome-agnostic `204`. | `usecases.GetPackage`, `usecases.GetPackagesByOrderRef` ([ADR-0033](https://github.com/IQVO/fulfillment-execution/blob/develop/docs/docs/adr/0033-package-read-model.md)) | No |

## Terms borrowed from the wider reference model

These come from the fulfilment reference model and appear in this context's
prose, though not all are modelled here as types:

| Term | Meaning | Modelled here? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tote** | The container that carries items from pick to pack, with a physical *and* virtual map of contents. | No — implicit in the Pick path narrative. |
| **Pod** | A mobile storage tower of coded bins; robots carry pods to stations. | No — belongs to WCS / `inventory-storage`. |
| **Bin** | A coded slot within a pod or shelf; the unit of location. | No — `facility-layout` and `inventory-storage` own location. |
| **Waveless release** | Continuous release of work rather than batching into waves. | No — that is `wes-work-planning`'s decision; this context only receives what was released. |
| **Item picked** | The item-level retrieval fact inside a Pick task. | Partly — event `ItemPicked` is defined but no use case raises it. |

## Terms that look shared across contexts but are not

The reference model warns that "same word, different model is allowed — and
expected," and that forcing a shared type across the boundary is the classic
DDD trap.

| Word | Here it means | Elsewhere it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Task** | An execution-level unit bound to a claiming station at a specific moment; disposable once completed. | In a WMS, a *business-level demand signal* tied to an order's fulfilment lifecycle — it persists, has an SLA, has priority. Deliberately not a shared class. |
| **ShiftPlan** | Not modelled. | `workforce-management` owns a committed headcount split across paths; `wes-work-planning` has its *own* different `ShiftPlan`. |
| **WorkUnit** | Arrives as `orderRef` — an opaque correlation key, nothing more. | In `wes-work-planning` it is a first-class aggregate with release state. |
| **Station** | A work position with capabilities, claimable-from. | In `workforce-management` the equivalent concern stops at the **path** level — it never links an associate to a station or a task. |
| **Location** | Only an opaque optional `locationCode` on `Station`, role-checked at registration. A `Task` carries no location. | `facility-layout` owns the location hierarchy and roles; `inventory-storage` owns what is *in* a bin. |
| **Order** | Not modelled; `orderRef` is a WorkUnit id. | `order-management` owns the order, its promise and re-promise. |

Every one of these is translated at the boundary rather than shared. The
`WorkReleased` consumer is the concrete example: it decodes the CloudEvent,
reads `path_id`, `work_unit_id`, `cpt`, `fragile` and `gift_wrap`, resolves
the path through the catalogue, and constructs *this* context's types. No
upstream struct crosses the line.
