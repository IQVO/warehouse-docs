# Bounded Context Canvas

This page is a copy of [`docs/ddd/bounded-context-canvas.md`](https://github.com/IQVO/network-fulfillment/blob/develop/docs/ddd/bounded-context-canvas.md) on `develop`, derived from that repository's code. Edit it there, then re-sync.

Following the ddd-crew [Bounded Context Canvas v5](https://github.com/ddd-crew/bounded-context-canvas).
Every message row maps to a real route, MCP tool, port call or Kafka topic
in the code on `develop`.

## Name

**Network Fulfillment** (`network-fulfillment`, CloudEvents subdomain `wes`).

## Purpose

To be the one place where the fleet meets an external retail fulfillment
network. Since ADR 0009 the counterpart is the fleet's own `retail-network`
service; the original learning target was a large retailer's Selling Partner
API. The context:

- receives the network's demand by polling;
- answers it inside the network's 24-hour window, acknowledged in full or
  rejected in full, using `order-management`'s feasibility verdict;
- reconciles each asynchronous submission before it releases any work;
- confirms shipment when it is told one happened;
- computes the throughput-constrained quantity it would advertise
  (`CapabilityOffer`).

The network's vocabulary never reaches the rest of the fleet, and no
ship-to PII enters this context at all.

## Strategic Classification

| Axis | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| **Domain** | **Supporting Subdomain** (ADR 0001). See [core-domain-chart.md](/contexts/network-fulfillment/core-domain-chart). |
| **Business Model** | Revenue-channel enabler: it lets the building's fulfillment capability be sold through an external network without any other context knowing the network exists. |
| **Evolution** | Custom-built (the ACL and the acknowledgement protocol). `CapabilityOffer` is Genesis → Custom. The counterpart's API is a Product that this context conforms to. |

## Domain Roles

| Role | Applies? | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Gateway / Anti-Corruption Layer** | **Yes, primary** | The network vocabulary stops at `internal/adapters/outbound/network/`. `ports.NetworkGateway` and `contract.*` are expressed in our terms, and `NetworkOrder.SKUQuantities()` is the only shape sent to `order-management`. |
| **Execution (protocol)** | **Yes, narrow** | Owns the answer, the 24h clock (`acknowledgeBy`, the sweep, `RejectOverdueOrders`) and reconciliation. It does not own the fulfillment work, which belongs to `order-management`. |
| **Analysis** | **Yes, opt-in** | `RecomputeCapabilityOffers` derives advertised availability from inventory, the CPT schedule and path capacity (`CAPABILITY_OFFER_ENABLED`). |
| **Published Language / Open Host** | **Partly** | Publishes 5 CloudEvents types on `warehouse.network-fulfillment.events` (documented in `apis/asyncapi.yaml`). No other fleet context was found consuming them. Read-only REST and MCP are exposed for operators and agents. |

## Ubiquitous Language

Full glossary: [ubiquitous-language.md](/contexts/network-fulfillment/ubiquitous-language). Top terms:
**NetworkOrder**, **NetworkRef**, **NetworkProductId** (≠ **SKU**),
**LocalOrderId**, **requiredShipBy**, **acknowledgeBy**, **held order**,
**Submitted** (accepted-for-processing, not yet a commitment),
**CapabilityOffer** with **Basis** `PHYSICAL` / `THROUGHPUT_CONSTRAINED`,
**RejectionReason**.

## Business Decisions

1. **Answer once, in full or not at all.** `Submit` and `Reject` are each
   allowed only once (`ErrAlreadyAnswered`). There is no partial
   acknowledgement, and the held order is raised with
   `allowPartialShipment: false`.
2. **One unknown product rejects the whole order** inside the window, and
   the refusal is recorded (`ReceiveUntranslatable`,
   `RejectionReasonUntranslatableSKU`), not dropped.
3. **Feasibility is asked, never computed.** A null `promiseDate` from
   `POST /orders` is the verdict "not feasible" (ADR 0001 §7).
4. **Hold, submit, reconcile, then release.** Work reaches the floor only
   after `SubmissionStatus` reports `SUCCESS` (`ReconcileSubmittedOrders`).
   `FAILURE` cancels the hold and rejects (`SUBMISSION_FAILED`).
5. **Free the hold first.** Every rejection path cancels the held order
   before it mutates the aggregate.
6. **A missed deadline is reported, then refused, and never answered
   late.** The sweep only publishes `AcknowledgementDeadlineAtRisk`.
   `RejectOverdueOrders` rejects with `ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_DEADLINE_MISSED`.
7. **Correlation is a persisted mapping** (`local_order_id`, guarded by a
   `CHECK` constraint). It is never a string convention, and that is why
   shipment confirmation is an explicit call (ADR 0014), not a
   `PackageManifested` join.
8. **Advertise what the floor can move.** `advertisedQuantity` is
   `min(physical, throughputFeasible)` and is never above physical
   (`ErrAdvertisedExceedsPhysical`). If capacity is unknown, the offer
   falls back to physical.
9. **`NETWORK_MODE` defaults to `stub`.** `live` refuses to boot until an
   adapter exists, and the chosen mode is logged and exposed on
   `/inbound-status`.

## Assumptions

- `order-management` remains the single authority on promises, and its
  ADR 0020 hold contract (`releaseOnAllocation`, ship-complete) stays
  stable.
- The counterpart's inbound model stays poll-only, and its submissions stay
  asynchronous with a transaction-status query.
- A curated `PRODUCT_TRANSLATION_FILE` is present wherever demand should be
  accepted. Without it, every order is rejected.
- Single site: `RecomputeCapabilityOffers` targets one `SITE_ID`, the same
  simplification as `order-management` ADR 0014.
- The opt-in caches can fully replay their topics within
  `WaitReadyTimeout` (60s each) at boot.

## Verification Metrics

- `GET /inbound-status`: `failed` poll count, `unanswered` and `overdue`
  counts. An overdue order is a missed external SLA.
- The `AcknowledgementDeadlineAtRisk` rate, and rejections split by
  `RejectionReason`.
- Acknowledgement report: average acknowledgement latency, received vs
  acknowledged, and rejections by cause (`acknowledgement_rollup`).
- Share of `THROUGHPUT_CONSTRAINED` offers per recompute pass (logged as
  `throughput_constrained`).
- `circuit_breaker_state` gauge for the `order-management` dependency.
- Engineering gates: arch-go hexagonal tests, 90% coverage, gremlins on
  `./internal/domain/networkorder`.

## Open Questions

- **When does a live `retail-network` adapter land**, and when does
  `CapabilityOffer` get submitted outward (`SubmitAvailability` has no
  caller)?
- **Acknowledged-before-settled event.** `NetworkOrderAcknowledged` is
  published when the order goes `SUBMITTED`, before reconciliation, and no
  event marks `SUBMITTED -> ACKNOWLEDGED`. Is that the intended contract
  for subscribers?
- **Orphaned hold after a crash.** If the process dies after
  `RaiseHeldOrder` but before the answer is saved, the order stays `NEW`
  with no `localOrderId`. `RejectOverdueOrders` then cannot cancel the hold
  in `order-management`. ADR 0001 names the orphaned hold as an open gap.
- **Cycle time is not yet used.** `contract.EligiblePath.CycleTimeP95` is
  cached, but `throughputFeasible` sums only remaining capacity.
- **Contract drift.** `apis/openapi.yaml` does not document
  `GET /capability-offers` or the shipment-confirmation `POST`. CORS allows
  only `GET/OPTIONS`. `ErrConfirmBeforeAcknowledge` maps to a 500.
