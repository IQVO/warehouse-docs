# Ubiquitous Language

:::info[Built on develop, not deployed]
Built on develop (merged 2026-11-08) in [IQVO/yard-management](https://github.com/IQVO/yard-management), not deployed: registered nowhere in warehouse-infra. The page still derives from [`yard/model/model.yaml`](https://github.com/IQVO/warehouse-docs/blob/main/yard/model/model.yaml); where the as-built service differs, the model and this page say so (see the as-built notes).
:::

The yard-wide glossary is on
[Ubiquitous Language](/yard/strategic-design/ubiquitous-language). Code
identifiers are the Go names found in `internal/domain` of the built service (`package.Type`); `-` marks a term that
names no single type.

## This context's terms

From `contexts[yard-management].ul`.

| Term | Definition | Code identifier | Not to be confused with |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Yard** | The enclosed area outside a site's four walls: gate, parking spots and dock doors. | `-` | **Warehouse floor** (inside the walls, owned by the other fleet contexts) |
| **Yard Visit** | One tractor and driver passing the gate, from check-in to check-out. | `yardvisit.Visit` | **Dock Appointment** (`dock-scheduling`: a booked window; a visit may or may not name one) |
| **Trailer** | Any towable unit on site, including a container on a chassis (SAP calls it a transportation unit). | `trailer.Trailer` | **Tractor** (the powered unit; only its plate is held, on the visit) |
| **Spot** | A Yard location (`facility-layout` role `Yard`) a trailer parks on. | `shared.Location` | **Dock Door** |
| **Holding Spot** | A spot for walk-ins and early arrivals, named in the yard policy. | `yardpolicy.Policy` | **Spot** in general (a holding spot is one the policy lists in `holding_spot_codes`) |
| **Dock Door** | A Dock location (`facility-layout` role `Dock`) with a `dockFlow` of Inbound, Outbound or Both. | `shared.Location` | **Door Window** (`dock-scheduling`: time on a door, not the door) |
| **Live Load / Live Unload** | The tractor waits at the door while the trailer is worked. | `shared.Purpose` | **Drop** |
| **Drop** | The trailer is left in the yard and the tractor leaves without it. | `shared.Purpose` | **Live Unload** |
| **Bobtail** | A tractor without a trailer. | `shared.Purpose` | **Drop** (a drop leaves a trailer behind; a bobtail brings none) |
| **Hostler** | Yard driver (also jockey, spotter, shunter) who moves trailers with a yard truck. | `yardmove.Performer` | **Visiting Driver** (the carrier's driver; moves only the first move from the gate) |
| **Yard Move** | An instruction to take one trailer to a spot or a door. | `yardmove.Move` | **Dock Appointment** (a booking, not an instruction to move) |
| **Door Work** | Unloading or loading while a trailer is docked; `WAITING`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`. | `trailer.DoorWork` | **Receipt** (`inbound-receiving`: the receiving of an ASN's goods) |
| **Dwell** | Time on site from gate-in to gate-out (per trailer: arrival to departure). | `trailer.Trailer` | **Detention** |
| **Seal** | The numbered seal on a trailer's doors; `INTACT`, `BROKEN` or `NONE`. | `trailer.SealState` | **Expected seal** (`expected_seal_number` on the appointment: what the carrier declared) |
| **Yard Check** | A yard audit reconciling observed trailers with the model. | `yardcheck.Check` | — |
| **Detention** | Carrier waiting time charged beyond the agreed free time; the free time is a site setting. | `yardpolicy.Policy` | **Dwell** (a duration; detention is the chargeable part beyond free time) |

There is no move to the gate: `VisitingDriverMove` says so, and a `Location` is only a `SPOT` or a `DOOR`. A
departing trailer leaves from a spot or, for a live visit, from the door. This pack's earlier wording (gap
YM-G2) is settled by decision Y-1.

## Neighbour terms used here

| Term | Definition (owner) | Code identifier | Not to be confused with |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Dock Appointment** | A booked window on one door for one carrier visit, inbound or outbound (`dock-scheduling`). | `dockappointment.DockAppointment` | **Yard Visit** |
| **Door Window** | The half-open interval `[start, end)` an appointment holds on its door (`dock-scheduling`). | `dockappointment.Window` | **Door Work** |
| **Door Calendar** | A site's door opening hours, closures and booking settings (`dock-scheduling`). | `dockcalendar.DockCalendar` | **Yard Policy** |
| **Closure** | A period a door cannot be booked (maintenance, damage); here it also means the door takes no trailer (`dock-scheduling`). | `dockcalendar.Closure` | **Hold** (on a trailer, not a door) |
| **Arrival Status** | `EARLY`, `ON_TIME` or `LATE`, computed by `dock-scheduling` from the gate arrival (`dock-scheduling`). | `dockappointment.ArrivalStatus` | **Visit Purpose** |
| **No-Show** | A booked appointment whose carrier did not arrive by window end plus grace (`dock-scheduling`). | `dockappointment.NoShow` | **Rejection** (a visit turned away at the gate) |
| **SCAC** | Standard Carrier Alpha Code identifying the carrier. | `shared.Carrier` | **Unit Number** |
| **CPT** | Critical pull time: the fleet's outbound cutoff (`process-path-management`). | consumed by `dock-scheduling`, not here | — |
| **Location Slot** | A registered place in a site; role `Yard` or `Dock`, with `dockFlow` for a dock (`facility-layout`). | `LocationSlotRegistered` | **Spot** and **Dock Door** (the slot is the registry entry) |
| **Zone** | A named area; `ZoneRegistered` maps `zoneId` to `siteCode` (`facility-layout`). | `ZoneRegistered` | **Parking zone** (a zone the yard policy lists in `parking_zone_ids`) |
| **Site Code** | `facility-layout`'s `siteCode`; the `site_id` on every yard event. | `site_id` | A location code (never parsed to find the site) |
| **ASN** | Advance shipping notice (`inbound-receiving`); `ASNRegistered` tells what an inbound trailer may hold. | `asn_number` | **Receipt** |
| **Receipt** | The act of receiving goods at a door; `ReceiptOpened` and `ReceiptClosed` (`inbound-receiving`). | `receipt_id` | **Door Work** (the yard's view of the same time at the door) |

No translation table with the retail network: this context does not touch it
(`meta.hard_boundary`).
