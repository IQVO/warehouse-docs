# Sequence Diagrams

:::info[Built on develop, registered in infra, not applied]
Built on develop (merged 2026-11-08) in [IQVO/yard-management](https://github.com/IQVO/yard-management), registered in warehouse-infra develop (apps.yaml entry, helm values, dashboards and alert rules, image pinned at v0.1.1), not applied to the k3s cluster (no pods). The page still derives from [`yard/model/model.yaml`](https://github.com/IQVO/warehouse-docs/blob/main/yard/model/model.yaml); where the as-built service differs, the model and this page say so (see the as-built notes).
:::

Two parts. **Part A** has the four scenarios the pack must show, each as one story
across several use cases: inbound adapter → use cases → aggregates → outbox → relay →
Kafka → neighbour. **Part B** has one diagram per significant command use case of
[Use Cases](/yard/contexts/yard-management/use-cases), in the hexagonal layout of the built service:
inbound adapter → use case → aggregate → repository → outbox (same transaction) → relay →
Kafka. The relay and Kafka share one lifeline ("relay to Kafka") to keep each diagram at
six participants or fewer. `alt` blocks show error branches, optimistic-concurrency
`version` checks and idempotency (REST `Idempotency-Key`, Kafka inbox on the CloudEvents
`id`). Error names are the model's; HTTP statuses of domain errors follow decision D-10: 409 conflicts, 422 value rules (see
[Use Cases](/yard/contexts/yard-management/use-cases#conventions-for-every-use-case)).
Route parameters are written without braces. The relay publishes integration events to
`warehouse.yard-management.events` and, as a twin, to `warehouse.yard-management.analytics`; analytics-only events
go to the analytics topic alone. Both are keyed by the aggregate root id.

## Part A: the four scenarios

### A1. Live unload

An inbound carrier with a booked door: check-in, the visiting driver's move to the door,
docking, door work closed by the receipt, check-out.

```

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[yard-management].policies[DirectOnCheckIn,
VisitingDriverMove, AutoCompleteUnload]`, `.aggregates[YardVisit, Trailer, YardMove]`,
`.publishes`; `contexts[dock-scheduling].policies`.

Omitted: the failure branches (Part B), the analytics events (`VisitCheckedOut`,
`DoorWorkStarted`, `YardMove*`; `DoorWorkCompleted` and `TrailerDeparted` also go to the integration topic since
2026-11-09), and `inbound-receiving`'s own receipt flow. `Depart` from the door under `CheckOutVisit` raises
`TrailerUndocked` and `TrailerDeparted` (decisions Y-2, Y-6). The dock operator or gate clerk completes the
first move through the completion route (decision Y-3).

### A2. Drop, then a later door call

A carrier drops a trailer whose door is busy; the trailer waits in a spot; when the door
frees, a hostler moves it in; after unloading it is returned to a spot.

    Note over DS: CompleteOnDoorRelease<br/>appointment COMPLETED
    P->>U: POST moves/moveId/completions
    U->>A: Trailer PARKED at a free spot
```

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[yard-management].policies[DirectOnCheckIn, CallToDoor,
ClearDoorAfterWork]`, `.aggregates[Trailer, YardMove]`, `.publishes[TrailerUndocked,
TrailerDocked]`; `contexts[dock-scheduling].policies[CompleteOnDoorRelease]`.

Omitted: the door work commands (A1), `YardMoveRequested`, `YardMoveClaimed`,
`YardMoveCompleted` and `TrailerParked` (analytics only), the idempotency and inbox rows.
`CallToDoor` reacts to the own `TrailerUndocked`; this pack reads that as a consumer of
the own topic, as `dock-scheduling` consumes it. `StartMoving` from `DOCKED` (the claim of a `FROM_DOOR` move)
raises `TrailerUndocked` (decision Y-6); the trailer carries its appointment through `appointment_id` (decision X3);
the first move to a plain spot has the reason `TO_SPOT` (decision Y-4).

### A3. Gate rejection

A walk-in at a site that requires appointments; then a seal mismatch under both policies.

```mermaid

            U->>O: VisitRejected<br/>reason SEAL_MISMATCH
            O->>EM: VisitRejected
        end
    end
```

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[yard-management].aggregates[YardVisit]`
(`invariants`, `commands`), `.policies[SealCheckAtGate]`, `.aggregates[YardPolicy]`,
`.reasons[RejectionReason]`, `.publishes[VisitRejected, SealExceptionRaised]`;
`fleet_changes[exception-management]`.

Omitted: `ErrTrailerAlreadyOnSite` (reason `TRAILER_ALREADY_ON_SITE`), `UNKNOWN_APPOINTMENT`
and `SITE_REQUEST` rejections; the detail that `dock-scheduling` now receives `VisitRejected` and cancels the
appointment with `TURNED_AWAY` (decision X2). A refused `CheckInVisit` creates nothing and `RejectAtGate` records the
rejection (decision Y-5). The seal number arrives with the trailer at check-in, and a rejected visit's
`SealExceptionRaised` has a null `trailer_id` (decisions Y-5, Y-13).

### A4. A hostler claims a move, the lease expires, another hostler completes it

```mermaid

    else free

        U->>O: YardMoveCompleted<br/>TrailerParked or TrailerDocked
        U-->>H2: 200 move
    end
```

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[yard-management].aggregates[YardMove, Trailer]`
(`transitions`, `invariants`, `notes`), `.policies[LeaseExpirySweep]`, `.inbound`, `.rest`.

Omitted: the `Idempotency-Key` rows; `ErrHostlerBusy` when a hostler already holds a
`CLAIMED` move; the late completion after expiry when nobody has re-claimed the move,
which is `ErrIllegalTransition` (the move is `REQUESTED`). The expiry returns the move to
`REQUESTED` and `ReturnToOrigin` brings the trailer back (decision Y-1), raises `YardMoveLeaseExpired` (decision
Y-10) and has no lease renewal. A refusal at `ArriveAt` still happens when the hostler is already at the
location; the destination was also validated when the move was requested (decision Y-8).

## Part B: one diagram per significant command

Commands not drawn follow a pattern shown here: `RejectAtGate` (A3); `RecordArrival`,
`DirectOnCheckIn` inside B1; `StartMoving` inside B4; `ArriveAt` inside B5; `Depart`
inside B2; `RecordSeal`, `BreakSeal`, `RecordLoadState`, `ReleaseHold` as B9 (load, check
state, mutate, version check, optional outbox row); `OpenYardCheck`, `RecordObservation`
and `DeclareYardPolicy` as B11 without the outbox.

    RL->>O: claim unpublished rows

```

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[yard-management].aggregates[YardVisit, Trailer]`
(`commands`, `invariants`), `.policies[DirectOnCheckIn, VisitingDriverMove,
SealCheckAtGate]`, `conventions.integration_rules`.

Omitted: the `REJECT` seal outcome (A3); the choice of door, holding spot or parking spot
(A2); each domain error is answered `409` or `422` (decision D-10). The first move's events
(`YardMoveRequested`, `YardMoveClaimed`) go to the analytics topic; the move is created `CLAIMED`, so the
service raises both (decision Y-1).

### B2. CheckOutVisit

```

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[yard-management].aggregates[YardVisit, Trailer]`
(`invariants`, `transitions`), `.publishes[VisitCheckedOut, TrailerDeparted,
TrailerUndocked]`.

Omitted: the idempotency-key check (as in B1). `Depart` is called from here for each trailer taken out
(decision Y-6). For a live visit the trailer leaves from the door: released means no open move and either
`PARKED` or `DOCKED` with door work `DONE` (decision Y-2).

### B3. RequestMove

```

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[yard-management].aggregates[YardMove]`
(`invariants`, `commands`), `.policies[CallToDoor, ClearDoorAfterWork]`.

Omitted: the idempotency-key check; the Kafka inbox row when a policy is the caller. The
destination is validated at the request (known slot, closure, flow, hold, `ErrDestinationReserved`,
`ErrTrailerHasOpenMove`) and again at arrival (decision Y-8).

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[yard-management].aggregates[YardMove, Trailer]`
(`invariants`, `transitions`, `notes`), `.business_decisions`.

Omitted: the idempotency-key check. The claim order is the lowest band, then `due_by`, then request time
(decision Y-11); with nothing to claim the answer is `404 no-claimable-move`; a claim from a door raises
`TrailerUndocked` (decision Y-6).

```

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[yard-management].aggregates[YardMove, Trailer]`
(`invariants`, `notes`), `.read_models[LocationView, DoorClosureView]`.

Omitted: the idempotency-key check. For a `VISITING_DRIVER` move there is no lease; the dock
operator or gate clerk completes it through the same route (decision Y-3). The partial unique index on active
occupancy is the race-safe backstop for `ErrLocationOccupied`.

### B6. ExpireLease

    loop each expired move
        U->>A: ExpireLease
        alt no longer CLAIMED
            A-->>U: skipped
        else CLAIMED
            A-->>U: Move REQUESTED, lease cleared<br/>destination stays reserved
            U->>R: update where version matches
            alt version changed
                U-->>U: skipped, next sweep
            else saved

            end
        end
    end
    U-->>H: 200 expired count
    H-->>CR: 200
```

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[yard-management].policies[LeaseExpirySweep]`,
`.aggregates[YardMove].transitions`.

Omitted: the outbox row for `YardMoveLeaseExpired` (analytics only, decision Y-10) and the
`ReturnToOrigin` step on the trailer (decision Y-1), both in the same unit of work as the move. Each
move is its own transaction, so one conflict does not stop the sweep.

### B7. CancelMove

        end
    end
    Note over O,RL: after commit
    RL->>O: claim unpublished rows
    Note over RL: publish to warehouse.yard-management.analytics
    RL->>O: mark published
```

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[yard-management].aggregates[YardMove].transitions`,
`.policies[NoShowFreesHolding]`.

Omitted: the idempotency check and the inbox row. A cancelled `CLAIMED` hostler move runs `ReturnToOrigin` in the same
unit of work, so the trailer goes back where it was (decision Y-1); the policy finds the move through the
`appointment_id` that the move carries (decisions X3, Y-14).

### B8. StartDoorWork and CompleteDoorWork

```mermaid

                U->>O: insert DoorWorkStarted<br/>or DoorWorkCompleted
                U-->>H: 200 trailer
            end
        end
    end
    Note over O,RL: after commit
    RL->>O: claim unpublished rows
    Note over RL: publish to warehouse.yard-management.analytics
    RL->>O: mark published
```

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[yard-management].aggregates[Trailer]`
(`value_objects[DoorWork]`, `commands`), `.policies[AutoCompleteUnload,
ClearDoorAfterWork]`, `.publishes[DoorWorkStarted, DoorWorkCompleted]`.

Omitted: the `AutoCompleteUnload` caller (a `ReceiptClosed` consumer: inbox row instead of
the idempotency key, joining `ReceiptAtDoorView` to the trailer through `receipt_id`, decision Y-7) and the
follow-up `RequestMove` of `ClearDoorAfterWork` for a `DROP` trailer (B3). `AutoCompleteUnload` completes from
`WAITING` or `IN_PROGRESS`; an operator's completion needs `IN_PROGRESS` (assumption A11).

### B9. PlaceHold

                U-->>H: 200 trailer
            end
        end
    end
    Note over O,RL: after commit
    RL->>O: claim unpublished rows
    Note over RL: publish to warehouse.yard-management.analytics
    RL->>O: mark published
```

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[yard-management].aggregates[Trailer]`
(`invariants[ErrTrailerOnHold]`, `commands`), `.reasons[HoldReason]`.

Omitted: the idempotency-key check. A hold on an already `DOCKED` trailer is allowed and door work waits for
the release (decision Y-13); a held trailer is refused docking at `ArriveAt` (B5).

### B10. DwellSweep

    loop each trailer on site
        U->>A: dwell = now minus ArrivedAt
        alt below threshold or already reported
            A-->>U: nothing to raise
        else threshold crossed
            Note over U,O: one transaction per trailer
            U->>R: mark crossing reported
            U->>O: insert TrailerDwellExceeded
        end
    end
    U-->>CR: 200 raised count
    Note over O,RL: after commit
    RL->>O: claim unpublished rows
    Note over RL: publish to warehouse.yard-management.events
    RL->>O: mark published
```

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[yard-management].policies[DwellSweep]`,
`.aggregates[YardPolicy]` (`dwell_threshold_minutes`), `.publishes[TrailerDwellExceeded]`.

Omitted: a kind with no threshold (skipped). The marker that makes the sweep "once per
trailer and threshold crossing" is `dwell_alerted_at` on the trailer (decision Y-13); the sweep has no aggregate
command of its own.

### B11. CloseYardCheck

```mermaid
%%{init: {"sequence": {"wrap": true, "width": 104, "actorMargin": 12, "messageMargin": 26, "boxMargin": 6, "noteMargin": 6, "mirrorActors": false}}}%%

    end
    Note over O,RL: after commit
    RL->>O: claim unpublished rows
    Note over RL: publish to warehouse.yard-management.events
    RL->>O: mark published
```

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[yard-management].aggregates[YardCheck]`,
`.publishes[YardCheckClosed]`.

Omitted: the idempotency-key check. `OpenYardCheck` and `RecordObservation` are the same
shape without the outbox row (`ErrYardCheckOpen` and `ErrLocationAlreadyObserved` as the
guards). The discrepancy rules are decision Y-11 (a location not observed is `MISSING` when the model records a trailer
there) and nothing applies a discrepancy to a trailer: closing only reports; `exception-management` opens one case
per discrepancy.
