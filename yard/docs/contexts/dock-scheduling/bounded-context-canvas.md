# Bounded Context Canvas

:::info[Built, released at v0.1.2, applied to k3s (reduced footprint)]
Built on develop (merged 2026-11-08) in [IQVO/dock-scheduling](https://github.com/IQVO/dock-scheduling), released at v0.1.2 (first release v0.1.0 on 2026-11-09) and applied to the k3s cluster on 2026-11-10 in a reduced footprint: dock-scheduling runs its API only (it relays inline); yard-management runs its API and relay. Their MCP servers, analytics projectors, report services and sweeps are registered in warehouse-infra but switched off until the cluster has room, so the KPI reports of yard-management ADR 0011 are released, not yet served. The page still derives from [`yard/model/model.yaml`](https://github.com/IQVO/warehouse-docs/blob/main/yard/model/model.yaml); where the as-built service differs, the model and this page say so (see the as-built notes).
:::

Following the ddd-crew [Bounded Context Canvas v5](https://github.com/ddd-crew/bounded-context-canvas).
Every message row comes from `contexts[dock-scheduling]` → `inbound`, `rest`,
`publishes`, `consumes` and `sync_calls` (empty).

## Canvas at a glance

Two pictures of the sections below: first the collaborators that command,
query or feed this context (with its purpose, roles and the decisions it
enforces), then the collaborators it notifies. Arrows follow the message
type: **solid blue** commands (`cmd`), **dotted green** queries (`qry`),
**thick orange** events (`evt`). Box shapes mark the collaborator kind:
rounded = people or any client; blue = sibling bounded context; grey = this
context's own scheduler; dashed = published with no named consumer
(analytics only). Channel names are abbreviated; the tables carry the exact
route, topic and CloudEvents type.

Derived from: `model.yaml → contexts[dock-scheduling].inbound`,
`.rest`, `.publishes`, `.consumes`, `.business_decisions`, `.roles`.

Omitted: assumptions, metrics, open questions and the glossary (sections
below); the relationship pattern per message (see the tables); full
CloudEvents types and routes (see the tables). There are no outbound
commands or queries: `sync_calls` is empty, so this context calls no other
context synchronously.

## Name

**Dock Scheduling** (`dock-scheduling`, code `DS`, CloudEvents subdomain
`wms`).

## Purpose

Own the door calendar of every site: every booked time window on every dock
door, inbound and outbound, from booking through arrival to door release, the
no-double-booking rule, door opening hours and closures, ETA-driven risk and
no-shows. It owns the **future** of a door; `yard-management` owns the
**present** of the yard. Each keeps an event-fed local copy of what it needs
from the other, and neither records the other's facts.

## Strategic Classification

| Axis | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| **Domain** | **Supporting** (see [Core Domain Chart](/yard/contexts/dock-scheduling/core-domain-chart)). |
| **Business Model** | Cost reducer (carrier wait, detention, idle dock labour) and revenue protector (on-time inbound). |
| **Evolution** | Product. |

## Domain Roles

| Role | Evidence in the model |
| --- | --- |
| **Specification** (door calendar) | `DockCalendar` holds operating hours, closures and settings; every booking is checked against it; `GetDockCalendar` and `GetDoorAvailability` publish it. |
| **Gateway for carriers** (Open Host Service) | The carrier scheduler books, reschedules, cancels and reports ETAs over REST (`relationship: OHS`); any context queries over REST (OHS). |
| **Analysis** (adherence) | Read model `AdherenceReport`: on-time, early, late and no-show share per site and carrier, built from the analytics topic; route `GET /reports/schedule-adherence`. |

## Inbound Communication

The Kafka types are read from each producer's AsyncAPI and the service dispatches on the
full type string (`process-path-management` is in the `wes` tier:
`com.warehouse.wes.process-path-management.cptschedule.CPTScheduleChanged`).

Reports: `GET /reports/schedule-adherence` and `GET /reports/freshness` are served by
the separate `reports` binary from `apis/openapi-reports.yaml` (read-only, on the analytics
database) and have an `inbound` row of their own (dock planner, query).

## Outbound Communication

Topics are `warehouse.dock-scheduling.events` for integration events (each also goes, as a
twin, to the analytics topic) and `warehouse.dock-scheduling.analytics` for the events the
model marks `analytics only`. The relationship column is the model's for `yard-management`
and this pack's reading for the others.

## Ubiquitous Language

Full glossary: [Ubiquitous Language](/yard/contexts/dock-scheduling/ubiquitous-language).
Top terms: **Dock Appointment**, **Door Window**, **Door Calendar**,
**Closure**, **Arrival Status**, **No-Show**.

## Business Decisions

1. **One owner of door time.** Inbound and outbound appointments share one
   calendar per door; a door whose `dockFlow` is `Both` takes either
   direction.
2. **No overlap.** No two active (`BOOKED` or `CHECKED_IN`) appointments
   overlap on the same door; windows are half-open
   (`ErrDoorDoubleBooked`, enforced by domain service
   `DoorSchedule.CheckNoOverlap` under a per-door advisory lock).
3. **Direction fits the door.** `ErrDoorFlowMismatch`.
4. **Inside hours, outside closures.** `ErrDoorUnavailable`.
5. **Physical facts are applied, never recorded.** Arrival and door release
   come from `yard-management` events.
6. **No-show.** A `BOOKED` appointment with no arrival by `window_end` plus
   the site's no-show grace becomes `NO_SHOW`.
7. **Late ETA is advisory.** `DockAppointmentAtRisk`; nothing reschedules
   automatically.

## Assumptions

Each is an assumption of the model or of this pack's reading; the service's ADR 0002 and
ADR 0003 state the ones it relies on.

- `facility-layout` publishes every dock slot with its `dockFlow` and its
  `zoneId`, and every zone with its `siteCode`; a door reaches its site only
  through that join, never by parsing a location code
  (`conventions.site_key`).
- `inbound-receiving` publishes `ASNRegistered` before an appointment names
  that ASN; otherwise a booking is refused with `ErrUnknownAsn`.
- `process-path-management` publishes `CPTScheduleChanged` for a site before
  an outbound appointment names one of its `cpt_id` values.
- Yard events can arrive in any order across partitions (they are keyed by
  visit or trailer, not by appointment); `OutOfOrderYardFacts` is the rule
  that absorbs it.
- Consumers rebuild their views from events only; no sibling is called
  synchronously.
- The retail network is out of reach: no `retailnetwork.*` topic is consumed.

## Verification Metrics

Targets are this page's proposal; neither the model nor the service sets any. The service exports the counters named below (for example `dock_scheduling_ignored_facts_total` and `dock_scheduling_implicit_arrivals_total`).

| Metric | Target (proposed) | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active appointments that overlap on one door and are not flagged `DOOR_REASSIGNED_OVERLAP` | 0 | `dock_appointments` table, `ActualDoorWins` is the only allowed overlap |
| Share of appointments by `ArrivalStatus` (`EARLY`, `ON_TIME`, `LATE`) and by `NO_SHOW`, per site and carrier | report weekly | `AdherenceReport` |
| `BOOKED` appointments past `window_end` plus no-show grace | 0 after each sweep | `dock_appointments` table |
| `DockAppointmentAtRisk` per ETA report, by cause | report weekly | analytics topic |
| Yard facts ignored and counted (unknown, terminal, `CANCELLED`, `NO_SHOW`) | trend to 0 | use-case counter (policies `ArrivalFromGate`, `OutOfOrderYardFacts`) |
| Bookings refused, by `Err...` (`ErrDoorDoubleBooked`, `ErrDoorUnavailable`, `ErrUnknownAsn`) | report weekly | use-case error counter |
| Appointments completed with an implicit arrival (`BOOKED` to `COMPLETED`) | trend to 0 | `dock_appointments` table |
| Lag from a `yard-management` event to the matching `dock-scheduling` event | set before build | event timestamps |

## Closed questions

The gaps this page used to list (`DS-G01` to `DS-G22`) were decided before the build and are
folded into the service; the decision per gap is in the
[Model Gap Register](/yard/strategic-design/model-gap-register). In short: the arrival
tolerance travels on `Booked` and `Rescheduled` (`DS-G01`); `VisitRejected` cancels with
`TURNED_AWAY` (`DS-G02`); one appointment covers one trailer (`DS-G03`); `PickupFromCutoffs`
is phase 2 and only the schedule is stored (`DS-G04`, `DS-G05`); a reschedule may change the
door (`DS-G06`); the calendar is created lazily and open 24x7 until hours are declared
(`DS-G07`); the legacy import (removed in dock-scheduling ADR 0011) enforced nothing (`DS-G08`); the planner may cancel and
reschedule (`DS-G10`); the aggregate exposes `atRisk` (`DS-G11`); a decommissioned door blocks
new bookings only and new hours that strand an appointment are refused (`DS-G12`, `DS-G13`);
door codes are globally unique (`DS-G15`); `NO_SHOW` is terminal, a late carrier books anew
(`DS-G16`); `409` for conflicts and `422` for value rules (`DS-G17`).
